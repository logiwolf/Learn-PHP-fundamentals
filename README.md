# Learn-PHP-fundamentals
I’ve recently started the Udemy course by Brad Traversy, "PHP From Scratch 2024 | Beginner to Advanced." As of today (September 12, 2024), this is what I’ve learned from the course.

   Today, I gained a foundational understanding of PHP tags and their usage.
   
    1. set up your PHP development environment in VS Code, install the following extensions:
         - PHP Intelephense for intelligent autocompletion and analysis.
         - PHP DocBlocker for automated PHP docblocks.
         - Additionally, enable automatic formatting for PHP by adding the following configuration to my settings.json:

  
              "[php]":{
              "editor.formatOnSave": true,
              "editor.defaultFormatter": "bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client"
               }
               
    2. I executed PHP code on the localhost and rendered it in an HTML file. I then checked the browser's source code to verify if the PHP code was visible.

    
    3. I learned the shorthand syntax <?= "some text" ?>, which is a concise way to output text or variables in PHP.

    
    4. I added a PHP tag before the <html> tag to test if the HTML content is correctly rendered in the browser. Then, I verified whether the HTML tag is being displayed as expected.
    
## Any blockers/impediments:    

    So far, I haven't encountered any blockers.
